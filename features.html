    <h1>FEATURES</h1>
    1. The DNA of this animal helps it to survive in  extreme conditions such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures (both high and low), air deprivation,UV radiation, gravitional force ,dehydration, and starvation that would quickly kill most other known forms of life.<br>
    2. The black parts in the center of their eyes are vertical which can copen and close like a aperture of camera.<br>
    3. The haemocoel fluid present in their bodies functions as a circulatory system , in respiration and is rich in free - floating storage cells.<br>
    4. The ear of  xelius   help them hear the sounds made at night, they have a highly developed auditory (hearing) system. They also can detect the direction and helps them to move to the right path.<br>
    5. They have very brawny and long upper and lower limbs that are designed to give them both strength and agility. They are flexible and they are fast . They can be used for grabbing objects , running etc. <br>
    6. The eyes of  xelius gives paranomic feature . It is large , hooked beak , pale yellow iris with powerful vision . It works fine even at the night time . The muscles of the iris surrounding the pupils are constructed in a way that allows the eye to narrow to a vertical slit in bright light and to open fully in very dim light to allow maximum illuminations.<br>
    7. Cemeto Xelius is sent with analog sensor( pressure sensor ,thermal sensor , radiation sensor ) and digital sensor for collecting datas in space. <br><br>
    <h1>WORKING</h1>
    The working mechanism of Cemeto Xelius<br>
    Eyes - We have used the eye feature of cat which helps the Cemeto Xelius to see clearly in day and even at night which is really helpful when in space. Instead of having circular pupils like humans, the black parts in the centers of their eyes are vertical which can adapt quickly. Just like humans when it's dark out cats pupils expand to let in more light and enhance it's vision, but when it's bright out, it's pupils get smaller to prevent overstimulation.<br>
    Monkey Limbs - Monkey have strong limbs which helps Monkeys to run and grasp trees and branches. It will be easier for Semeto Xelius to move around in the space. Monkey have hair on their limbs where hair serves to insulate, to conceal, to signal, to protect, and to sense the immediate surroundings. Insulation serves to conserve to protect against excessive heat.<br>
    Tardigrade's body cavity - The tardigrades body has a type of body cavity called haemocoel that is filled with a type pf fluid that carries blood and oxygen which diffuses through the animalss integument and is stored in cells within the hemocoel . The most remarkable feature of the tardigrades is their ability to withstand extremely low temperatures and desiccation (extreme drying). Under unfavorable conditions, they go into a state of suspended animation called the “tun” state in which the body dries out and appears as a lifeless ball. So this feature will help Semeto Xelius to survive dehydration and extreme heat.<br>
    Deinococcus radiodurans - A type of extremophilic bacterium and one of the most radiation resistant organisms. It can survive cold dehydration , vacuum, and acid, and therefore is known as a polyextremophile. They are known for their resistance to multiple stresses and their capacity to repair DNA damage with unparalleled efficiency compared to other known bacterial species. This feature will help the animal to repair their DNA if damage occurred.<br>
    Methanopyrus kandeleri - Methanopyrus Kandeleri are the type of Archaea ( one of three primary lineages of modern cellular organisms ) which can occupy extreme environment. And Methanopyrus Kandeleri have the record for growth at highest temperature 121 °C
    <h1>POSSIBILITIES</h1>
    1. This superhero provides a slight idea about existence of such organisms which also might help to justify the existence of such aliens.<br>
    2. If developed further, this may also be able to solve many health problems such as cancer or it may also be used to be safe from harmful radiation and UV rays.<br>
    3. Animals like cemento xelius helps to collect sample and help the process in research . It might be a new start to field of science. It might go behind any science research and be the biggest revolution in space.<br>
    4. With advancement in this field it may even be possible to create superhumans using feautres of diffrent species and organisms.<br><br>
